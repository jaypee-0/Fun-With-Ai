## The Challenge
You will write an app that sends plain text prompts to the OpenAI API and displays the results in a list.

We'd like your app to have a simple-to-use interface that includes the following:
- A form for entering text prompts
- Submitting the form sends the prompt to the OpenAI API
- Results are displayed in a list, sorted from newest to oldest. Each result should include the original prompt and a response from the API.
